# Java language studies
This repository is all my knowledge "for now" in the Java language.
# About the studies
I study systems analysis and development and currently have knowledge mainly in front-end, so I decided to use the knowledge I have to learn the Java programming language. This repository contains all of my current Java study.
# Repository structure
The project is organized as follows:
